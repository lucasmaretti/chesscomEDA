Exploratory data analysis using public data from the chess.com API using Python

The draft notebook is where I explored the main packages used for parsing the data as well as where I sketched the function that will select some of this data to create a dataframe.

The data analysis notebook contains the exploratory data analysis done on such dataframe as the results presented in the article. Hope you enjoy and please let me know if you have any suggestions or commentaries for improvement.
